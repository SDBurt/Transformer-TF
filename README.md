# Transformer-TF

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to store the src code from my decomposition of the Transformer Model for Language Understanding tutorial found on the tensorflow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/text/transformer

## About
This decomposition aims to simplify the tutorial code and create modularity. Additions to this project, after results are similar to the tutorials, is to create GPT2 by OpenAI: https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/. I found their work to be facinating and inspirational.

## Results
This project is a work in progress and does not currently have similar results to the tutorial. Once progress with this project is made, results will be posted.
